# Deep-Learning-ELMo
Deep Learning ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) for DGA Detection

Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are often used by malware to generate domains used to connect to command and control servers. Recent work in DGA discovery has leveraged deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and character-level short-term memory networks (LSTMs) to classify domains
The project is based on testing different machine learning algorithms for the detection of malicious domain names, adapting them to the dataset assigned to us and then carrying out a binary classification, thus comparing the various results obtained (metrics) of the different algorithms.
In particular, the following algorithms will be tested: LSTM, Masked N-Grams, Bilbo and ELMo.

The files related to the ELMo algorithm are contained in this repository.
